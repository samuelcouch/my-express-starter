##My Express[js] starter

My typical workflow in starting a new project typically went as follows:
* Run `express -e`
  * Remove unwanted blocks
  * Rearrange other sections
  * `node app.js` to make sure I didn't break anything

This *sucks*. So I made a generic codebase to save me time. It's nothing special, it just keeps me from going crazy and lets me get to work quicker. Feel free to make other suggestion for additions or improvements.
